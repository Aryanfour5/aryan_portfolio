          <h2>About Me!</h2>
          <p> I'm Aryan Bachute, a passionate full-stack developer and AIML enthusiast with hands-on experience in Java, MySQL, and modern front-end frameworks like React and SvelteKit. Currently pursuing my degree at Symbiosis Institute of Technology, Iâ€™ve developed several impactful projects, including an investment portfolio tracker with real-time financial analytics and a blockchain-based bus management system, which won the IEEE Symposium 2024's build-a-thon. My internships in full-stack and Java web development have strengthened my skills in API integration, RESTful design, and efficient UI/UX. I am driven by a love for learning, with certifications in Python and full-stack web development, and enjoy solving coding challenges on LeetCode and HackerRank.
